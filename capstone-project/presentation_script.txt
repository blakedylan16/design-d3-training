As the title explains I was looking to explore the relationship between education attainment and poverty in my state, new york
I chose to look into this because of my own interests in making educational support more accessible.
When actually making the project, I wanted to look as easy to use and text-light as possible. I wanted the relationships to be easy to understood
for even some random high school student to stumble upon it. I know when I was younger, most research intimidated me.
I am fairly new to front-end development, the only visualizations I knew how to implement were the ones worked on in d3 modules.
But I knew from the start what I wanted it to look like so I learned what I needed to learn to make it happen.
I mainly observed two statistics, percentage of ppl with less than high school education and percentage of
ppl in poverty. As we go through the web app, you'll see that I color coordinated each page so that the blue will always be tied to education attainment 
and the orange will represent impoverishment.
This is the home page.
Here are the discoveries that I made.
Here is a short explanation for how to use the web app. It talks about the selector at the bottom, and how pretty much everything on each of the
visualizations have a hover mechanic built in to get more info.
The sources I used are at the bottom.
The first is the database that I was assigned for the project.
The second is s report I looked at a little bit to understand how to loosely categorize the counties into different area types:
 cities, rural areas, and towns
